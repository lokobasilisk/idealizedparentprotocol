Visualize yourself with an ideal parent.
First settle down in a comfortable position. 
Now, imagine yourself as a child. 
You are in a family different from your real family. 
These parents are suited to your personality.
Imagine yourself in a scene with them where these parents are totally attuned to your needs and your personality. 
These parents know how to comfort you in the way you need to be comforted. 
Specifically, think of scenes where these parents give you the utmost sense of security and satisfaction.
Now, imagine another scene with your ideal parents. 
They are completely interested in your habits, behavior, and all your developmental activities. 
These ideal parents discuss your growth, your hobbies, and your internal state of mind. 
You feel deeply noticed by them.
Now, imagine another scene with these ideal parents where you are upset. 
Your ideal parents know exactly how to soothe you. 
They understand your problem on a deeper level, and they respond the way you need. 
Imagine all the ways they comfort you physically and emotionally.
Imagine yourself exploring and discovering something new with these ideal parents. 
They support you completely and that is bringing out the best in you. 
Your ideal parents are honest and they support you in your unique quests. 
Now. Recall the lack you felt, the lack of something particular which you needed the most as a child, but never quite got. 
This feeling is a familiar one, and you have felt it many times before. Let yourself feel it now. 
Now, imagine your ideal parent steps into the scene and knows just the way you feel, and they respond in the exact way that you need them to respond. 
After every scene, notice the way you feel in the company of your ideal parent. 
Notice your feelings after you have been heard, comforted, and nurtured by this ideal parent who knows the deepest part of you and wants the best for you. 
You can journal about the scenes that you imagine with your ideal parents, and then write down the shift in your feelings after each scene.
